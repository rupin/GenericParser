# GenericParser

Most often than not, the ability to extract information from websites can save frustration and time for many people. 

The Generic Parser project allows non-coding folks to scrape websites easily and quickly. 

Steps to Start Using the Script main.py

There are three parts to the script
1) A template format in xlsx, that has the xpath pattern for every piece of information that needs to be extracted.
2) A downloaded html copy of the page. This is to ensure the page which is to be parsed has loaded fully versus from a URL.
3) An output file, which is generated by the script.

Most Websites have a pattern in which information is organised. This pattern is the outcome of websites generated from databases. Information visually looks spread out across the page, but structurally
is sequential and has a repeating pattern that can easily codified. 

The first step for the process is to build this codified pattern. For sake of example, lets us take the case where we are trying to scrape multiple choice questions from a website. 

The following information is what we wish to scrape
1) Question Text
2) Option A
3) Option B
4) Option C
5) Option D
6) Answer
7) Explanation for the answer.
